 The PHP in this is messy but it works.
 
 You may host this on a private network if you wish.
 
##INSTALL
- Place this folder in /var/www/delta/
- If using linux replace update_data.php with the one in the "Linux CRON Jobs" folder
- Setup crontab for www-data with the job in the "Linux CRON Jobs" folder
- Theroretically it should then work.
